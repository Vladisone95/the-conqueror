The Project was created using NextJs 14 with Typescript, and TailwindCss.

I used a component based architecture for the built pages (landing on "/" and the cart page on "/cart") within a defined layout where yo ucan find the header, footer, mobile burger menu.

Since the project was missing a defined typography, almost all the classes are used on the spot for each individual HTML tag.

Most of the spacing, sizes and responsiveness were achieved using common sense values, since I didn't manage to get the Figma project in dev mode, so all the component properties
were completely hidden for me, so keep in mind, there may be some differences in typography or spacing.

In the project I have build a really basic functionality to add cards to a shopping cart and to be able to view the added items in a checkout style box.

Almost all the link, dropdowns and buttons are placeholders.
